Your task for Jan 2014 is to complete a REST API for the FlyApp. That is, you don't have to worry about presentation, persistance or any other detail but you have to provide HTTP/JSON endpoints to perform all operations of the FlyApp. To be more specific, you must support:


* POST a flight (id, arrival, departure, from, to, status)
* GET a list of flights to X [within time]
* GET a list of flights from Y [within time]
* PUT an updated status to a flight (i.e: DELAYED, CANCELLED, Gate 42)
* DELETE a flight (maybe)
