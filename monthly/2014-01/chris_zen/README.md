### Create a flight

Create a new flight.

**POST** */flights*

The body contains the flight details as a *JSON* document with the following fields: *id*, *from*, *to*, *departure*, *arrival* and *status*.
All the fields are strings. *departure* and *arrival* are *DateTime*'s encoded in ISO format. Possible values for *status* are:
*ONTIME*, *DELAYED*, *CANCELLED*, *ONGATE*.

Example:

    {
        "id" : "IB001",
        "from" : "BCN",
        "to": "PARIS",
        "departure": "2014-01-28T12:35:00Z",
        "arrival": "2014-01-28T13:30:00Z",
        "status": "ONTIME"
    }

Return *201 Created* on success or a *400 Bad request* on failure due to wrong input.

When success, the response body is a *JSON* document with the flight *id*.

### List flights
