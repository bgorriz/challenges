## [Monthly challenges](./monthly/README.md)

These challenges are meant to dig deep on a FW, technology or a concept. These are more demanding in time than [microchallenges](../micro) and are aimed to create pet (or even real) applications using state-of-the-art frameworks or technologies. First challenges could be done individually and more complex ones by small teams. Each month a new challenge is going to be proposed and afterwards the experience shared in one (or more) meet ups. 

## APPLICATIONS

Here's a brief list of applications where the challenges might be focused. We won't try to solve an app in a month, instead, we'll try to solve in many ways a part of the app.
